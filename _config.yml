         Mosaic++ is a tool that produces [photomosaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic). It offers a range of options that have an effect on the final result. It can be 
         used for entertainment purposes or be converted to an applicable tool in fields like image processing or mesh generation.

          A plotting project made with Qt and QCustomPlot. The scope of the app is to generate graphs for various functions and to observe the steps taken by the algorithm in order to
          obtain the correct plotting.

          One of the homeworks at a Graph Theory course I took required us to compute the shortest path between
          two points on the map of Luxembourg. We were given the input data as a massive xml file consisting of
          nodes and edges and our task was to translate the latitude and longitude values into pixels on the screen,
          to plot them and let the user choose two points on the map, the points to be chosen would be the closest to
          where the mouse clicks. The homework also requested we implement both Dijkstra's and Bellam-Ford
          algorithms.

          This C++ code from 2019 solves the x-puzzle problem. I wrote it in my first year at University.
          The algorithm uses states to verify if the current current puzzle is in final form or not. It firstly checks if the
          game is resolvable or not based on the information on this [site](http://kevingong.com/Math/SixteenPuzzle.html).
          If it is solveable, it searches for the best move set(the one with the lowest number of moves that reaches a final state) using A*.
